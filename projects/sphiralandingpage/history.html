					<p>Sphira is a multi-scalar apparatus that focuses on bringing public attention to the portable cultivation and innovative consumption of spirulina. By combining a working photo-bioreactor with the modern gastronomy process of spherification, this study seeks to find the best possible solution to an edible sphere product. This fully automated device controlled by an interactive mobile application produces spheres containing high concentrations of live spirulina mixed with organic juices and cannabis terpenes. By having a closed system with precise nutrient controls our bioreactor attempts to produce spirulina void of flavour whilst maintaining optimum nutrition. This study attempts to conceptualize an apparatus that highlights the functional and aesthetic attributes of cell structures. By exposing internal functions and accentuating mechanical processes, Sphira will develop a commentary on the adaptability and integration of cell-mimicry in tangible, functional objects. In driving attention towards the process of spherification as a method of consuming spirulina the Sphira mobile application will also function as way to distribute spirulina cultures to new Sphira apparatuses whilst encouraging users to form communities discussing varying terpene and flavour combinations.</p>
					<p>This study, although in its infancy, attempts to conceptualize an apparatus that highlights the functional and aesthetic attributes of cell structures. By exposing internal functions and accentuating mechanical processes. Sphira will develop a commentary on the adaptability and integration of cell-mimicry in tangible, functional objects. This study will highlight the importance of multi- cell relationships working as a cohesive unity by incorporating varying glass containers within a stream-lined apparatus.</p>
					<p>This allows us to add various components such as coconut-pineapple juice to a concentrated spirulina solution that can then be formed into edible spheres.</p>
