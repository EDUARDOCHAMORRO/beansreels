		<p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="paragraph">WHAT IS A MULTICOPTER AND WHAT IS A DRONE ?</p>
		<p class="paragraph">A multicopter is a mechanically simple aerial vehicle whose motion is  controlled by speeding or slowing multiple downward thrusting  motor/propeller units.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">An <strong>unmanned aerial vehicle </strong>(<strong>UAV</strong>), commonly known as a <strong>drone,</strong> as an <strong>unmanned aircraft system</strong> (<strong>UAS</strong>), and also referred by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle#Definition_and_terminology">several other names</a>, is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard. The flight of UAVs may be controlled with various kinds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_automation" title="Vehicular automation">autonomy</a> :   either by a given degree of remote control from an operator, located on   the ground or in another vehicle, or fully autonomously, by onboard   computers</p>
		<p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="paragraph">In the image we can see on the left a REAPER MILITARY UAV that is a	&quot;drone&quot; due to his autonomous capabilities.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">On the right is commercial DJI Phantom that is also a &quot;drone&quot; but also can be controlled in manual mode.</p>
		<p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/22.jpg" width="700" height="390"></p>
		<p class="paragraph">The term "drone" is lazy and inexact. </p>
		<p class="paragraph">The fundamental difference between the terms &ldquo;<a href="http://dronewars.net/aboutdrone/" target="_blank">drone</a>&rdquo;   and &ldquo;quadcopter&rdquo; is one of characterization – drone is the general term   used for all unmanned aerial vehicles, though quadcopter identifies   with a particular set of drones with four engines that make lift for   vertical takeoff through their propellers</p>
		<p class="paragraph">1.  It isn't wrong to call almost any kind of remotely or self-directed vehicle a "drone."</p>
		<p class="paragraph">2.  All unmanned aircraft may be considered "drones."</p>
		<p class="paragraph">3.    It's basically impossible to come up with a currently flying example of   a quadcopter that isn't an unmanned aircraft (part of an "unmanned   aircraft system") and therefore, at the end of the day... a drone.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">Quadcopter is drone, it&rsquo;s a fact. Pretty much like bacon is pork or maybe...a cow ?</p>
		<p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/11305601-large.jpg" width="700" height="471"></p>
	  <p class="bluefullsize">What is the difference between a multicopter and a a drone ?</p>
		<p class="paragraph">A multicopter becomes a UAV or Drone when it is capable of autonomous  flight.  Normally this means taking the accelerometer and gyro  information and combining it with barometer and GPS data so the flight  controller understands not only it&rsquo;s orientation but also it&rsquo;s position.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">What does it means ? We can program it to go somewhere autonomously do something and return home.</p>
		<p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/Agriculture-Drone-Buyers-Guide-flight-plan-for-quadcopter.jpg"></p>
		<p class="paragraph">There is a video examplo of a &quot;drone&quot; multicopter wich can switch between &quot;manual mode &quot; and &quot;autonomous mode&quot;.

      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Usually we fly RC models in parks, or fields, but generally we fly by   watching the model flying while controlling it on the ground.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The main thing is, we always look at the model, check its position and control it accordingly.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">This is what we call LOS (line of sight) flying.      </p>
      <p class="paragraph"> FPV (which stands for First Person View) in its simplest form   regards adding a small video camera and video transmitter to your model.   Then, with a video receiver and a video display (video goggles, a video   monitor, or both), the pilot/copilot can view the image from the model   in real time, which gives the effect of "being in the cockpit."</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/fpvshow.jpg" width="700" height="357"><img src="beandrone/Typical-fpv-block.jpg" width="700" height="290"></p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Main components (FPV gear)</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">- video transmitter (vtx) + antenna (air)</p>
      <p class="paragraph">- micro camera (air)</p>
      <p class="paragraph">- video receiver (vrx) + antenna (gnd)</p>
      <p class="paragraph">- ground display unit (tv, lcd monitor, laptop display, video goggles, …)</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Extended components (improvements)</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">- low-pass&rdquo; filter (filters the unwanted frequencies, that can influence the RC link) (air)</p>
      <p class="paragraph">- LC filter (filters the current fluctuations that can affect the picture quality) (air)</p>
      <p class="paragraph">-ground station (integration of the vrx, monitor, video recorder and more to one unit, usually a suitcase) usually mounted on a tripod</p>
      <p class="paragraph">- diversity receiver (handles input from more antennas, selects the best signal) (gnd)</p>
      <p class="paragraph">- antenna tracker  system (turns the receiver antenna towards the model automated) </p>
      <p class="paragraph">- DVR (&ldquo;digital video recorder&rdquo; – records the picture coming from the vrx) (gnd)</p>
      <p class="paragraph">- power bank for the groundstation (gnd)</p>
      <p class="paragraph">- OSD, video information about position,orientation, altitute,etc embeded on the video image (air) </p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/fpvcomp.jpg"></p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>COMPONENTS ONE BY ONE: CAMERA</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">One of the most important components in FPV flying is the fpv camera. If   the camera is not good enough for the purpose, it has effect on the   whole flight. Be carefull while choose the voltage range they admit is usually small.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">CCD vs CMOS</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The advantage of the CCD sensors over CMOS is that there is no &ldquo;rolling   shutter&rdquo; effect on CCD cameras. On the other side, the CMOS cameras have   higher resolutions, thus, nice picture. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">&gt; &gt; Note that the maximum horizontal lines that the analog transmitter can transmit is 576</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/Super-mini-fpv-camera.jpg"></p>
      <p class="paragraph">VIDEO STANDART</p>
      <p class="paragraph">There are two major types of video standards that we use FPV cameras:   PAL and NTSC.  While the former has slightly bigger resolution, the   latter has slightly slower frame rate ( that means the image get refreshed faster, very important during fast flying)</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">RESOLUTION</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Camera resolutions are specified as TVL (TV lines) and go from 480 up to   1000. Usually, the higher the TVL value, the better the picture, even if the maximum analog transfer rate is of 576 tv lines, the superior quality built and lens, make the higher specs camera have a better final image with more focus,detail,color rate and fast change between dark/light areas.      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">F.O.V / CAMERA LENS</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The FOV or camera angle gives us information how much angle the camera   sees. The values are given in &ldquo;mm&rdquo; which equals to the focal length. The   lesser the number, the wider the angle. The cameras that are generally   used in FPV has 2.8mm lens that gives us around 90 degree angle   horizontal and 80 degree angle vertical. By using a 3.6mm lens this   decreases to 75/65 degrees. The more narrow the angle, the more details   we see on the picture</p>
      <p class="paragraph">As a good start point for beginners is to use a wide angle camera as it allows to see lot of things, but a cons it is more difficult to calculate distances</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">NIGHT VISION</p>
      <p class="paragraph">For night flying we use cameras that have very low LUX ratings. A camera   below 0.001 LUX can see nearly perfectly in the dark night.A nice camera in this family is fpv OWL micro camera (the image in this kind of camera is bitone due to what the camera sees is infrared emitance)</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>COMPONENTS ONE BY ONE: ANTENNA</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">The antenna is the essential component of every FPV system. When we say   &ldquo;essential&rdquo; we mean it. A wrong antenna can degrade the range of the   system to very low values, making flying impossible.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Linear are now considered by most as old school technology for FPV with   the realization of circular polarization, but it still has its place for small micro aplications.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Main attributes are:</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&gt; &gt; &gt;polarization ( vertical, horizontal, circular)</p>
      <p class="paragraph">This depicts how you mount an antenna to match the waveforms from   transmitter to receiver. An omin antenna has a linear polarized waveform   so when mounted upright the waveforms are transmitted vertically. The   receivers antennas polarization must then match to receive a polarized   signal</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&gt; &gt; &gt; directivity (omni, directional)</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&gt; &gt; &gt;SWR standing wave ratio </p>
      <p class="paragraph">When a receiver is connected to an antenna the impedance of the antenna   and feed line must match as close as possible for most efficient   reception</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;gain&quot; directivity </p>
      <p class="paragraph">The two antenna characteristics, among others, that impact link performance to a large degree are directivity and polarization.A simple dipole antenna has a gain of 2.15 dbi and has a directivity pattern, in free space, shaped like a torus or donut.his can be an advantage in some circumstances but in RC systems, that &ldquo; hole in the middle&rdquo; can be a real problem      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULD NEVER POINT THE ANTENNA AT YOUR MODEL.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/antenna-pattern.jpg"></p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&gt; &gt; &gt; bandwidth (wich band are they designed for)</p>
      <p class="paragraph"> An antenna designed for a specific frequency has certain   characteristics at that frequency only. As the frequency is changed,   plus or minus, from this center frequency, those characteristics will   change to some degree</p>
      <p class="paragraph">For radio systems that operate on a single frequency, bandwidth isn&rsquo;t   much of an issue. However, a number (if not most) of 2.4 GHz systems use   spread spectrum or frequency hopping technology, which require   operation over a range of frequencies. For these systems, bandwidth is   significant.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Most wifi,bluetooth,rc transmitters use the 2.4 ghz bandwitdh so it is a very noise band. To get best picture quality most of people use the 5.8ghz band that gives less penetration rate but better qualitity and it is much less busy.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Most used frecuencies are </p>
      <p class="paragraph">- 900mhz where the signal go easy around and penetrate walls and trees </p>
      <p class="paragraph">-1.2 ghz( 1200mhz) nice penetration but antennas are big,be carefull to stay away for GPS and airplane navigation frecuencies(1227.60 1575.42, 962-1213 mhz)</p>
      <p class="paragraph">-2.4ghz (used for long range fpv but you have to use another band transmitter),very crowded frecuency,much more antennas to choose</p>
      <p class="paragraph">-5.8ghz, perfect for short range,easy to setup,works with 2.4ghz transmitter, very small antennas.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Here you can see the comparison in size between a 1.2ghz and 5.8 ghz antenna.</p>

      <p class="paragraph"><strong>COMPONENTS ONE BY ONE: vTX,vRX)</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">The video transmitter is the device that transmits an analog (some   digital devices exists already) signal of the fpv video camera to the   ground, where a video receiver catches the signal and processes it.  The   signal is transmitted in SD quality, that means 576 horizontal lines.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/12431.jpg" width="700" height="244"></p>
      <p class="paragraph">ATTRIBUTES OF vTX</p>
      <p class="paragraph">-frecuency/band</p>
      <p class="paragraph">-RF power</p>
      <p class="paragraph">-input voltage</p>

      <p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/12312.jpg"></p>
      <p class="paragraph">ATTRIBUTES OF vRX</p>

      <p class="paragraph">-sensitivity</p>
      <p class="paragraph">-noise filtering</p>
      <p class="paragraph">-build (modular/cased)</p>
      <p class="paragraph">-diversity</p>
      <p class="paragraph">-number of AV out connectors      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">There are some more sophisticated solutions where one needs precise and   stable control all the time. In these cases, a technology called   &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; is used. It can be achieved either by multiplying the   receiver modules (static), or by using an antenna tracker module   (dynamic), that is able to track the multicopter in the air and   automatically position the antenna to get the best signal.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">Of course, loosing the picture in many cases means loosing the control and crash.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>How to get the maximum range</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Generally, the lower the frequency, the better is the penetration   (possibility for the signal to get through). Of course again, by using   high gain directional antenna, more sensitive receiver or higher RF   output power will help making the penetration better.      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">General rule of thumb is ALWAYS to increase the antenna gain/vRX   sensitivity, and AVOID increasing the vTX RF power. The reason is   simple, the high RF power levels can simply affect other devices   onboard, even the RX and this can lower the range for the RC link which   we need to avoid.Also note that by increasing the vTX power it will get more and more hot, and as a result it can easily burn out.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">A typical situation is when we use 2.4G for RC link (very widely used)   and we need high penetration so we use 1.2/1.3G for video. In this case   the vTX can (will) negatively affect the range of the RC link, that can   get down even to 1/10 of its maximum range.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>about FPV legality and safety</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Always obey the law when flying, and fly safely!  Laws vary from   locality to locality. Most video transmitters used for FPV flying   require an amateur radio license to operate legally, depends mainly on wich frecuencies/power you use. FPV hobby frecuencies are 800-900mhz, 1.2ghz ,2,4ghz, 5,8 ghz</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Most FPV video transmitters are broadband "analog" transmitters based on   1950's technology, with relatively limited range when compared to the   range of your RC radio. One way to increase the range of the video link   is to use a more powerful transmitter, but that uses more battery power. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Most commons power for FPV video transmitters are between 25mw (raceband) and 600mw.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Another way to improve range and video signal quality is to use two   receivers on the ground, and to automatically select the one that has   the stronger signal. This arrangement is called "diversity." Some ground   stations provide diversity when two receivers are connected to them.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Youtube is filled with &ldquo;how to fly a quadcopter&rdquo; instructional videos,   so that will be your starting point to figure out the basics. Once you   get the basics you can do some amazing stuff like drone racing from   point of view!</p>

      <p class="paragraph">- Throlle &gt; &gt; &gt; up/down in multicopters</p>
      <p class="paragraph">- Yaw / Rudder &gt; &gt; &gt; rotation on the Z axes</p>
      <p class="paragraph">- Roll / Ailerons &gt; &gt; &gt; rotation on the X axes</p>
      <p class="paragraph">- Pitch / Elevator &gt; &gt; &gt; rotation on the Y axes</p>

        <p class="paragraph">You'll see from the above 4 modes but few people fly anything other than   Mode 1 or 2. There are also modes 5-8 where the elevator is reversed so   the model goes up when you push the stick forward (yes, I have come   across somebody who flew this way, he had no help when he started out   and it made sense to him)</p>
        <p class="paragraph">There is no right or wrong way to learn, the percentages of people   flying on each mode varies in the UK and USA it is mainly mode 2, Europe   and Australia mode 1.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Most people the world over fly mode 1 or 2, so which should you chose?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The technical answer is that for aircraft mode 1 is considered better as   it separates the two main controls (aileron and elevator), which helps   when flying precision aerobatics, also helps turning in racing multirotors as you mainly rotate with the rudder aka yaw, but there are many top competitive   aerobatic pilots flying mode 2. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Mode 2 is considered easier to learn as   you predominately use your right hand and most people are naturally   right handed.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"> All the transmissions between the remote and the receiver come in a &quot;coded&quot; frecuency the normal outputs for Radiocontrol frecuencies are CPPM / PPM sum signal, S-BUS or Spektrum Satellite. They are mainly propietary brand modulations, so if you get a Spektrum you can only use spektrum products or modulation compatible one. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">We carefull wich one you buy the first time! Some are more expensives have more options than others. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">More commons modulations are :</p>
