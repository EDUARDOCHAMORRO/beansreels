						<h1>Flight Controller</h1>
						<p>The "brain" of everything</p>
					</header>
						<P>
							 A flight controller (a.k.a FC) is the brain of the aircraft. It is basically a circuit board that has built-in sensors that detects orientation changes. It also receives user commands, and controls the motors in order to keep the quadcopter in the air.
						</P>
						<P>
							<B>Nearly all flight controllers have basic sensors such as Gyro (Gyroscopes) and Acc (Accelerometer). Some FC might include more advanced sensors such as Barometer (barometric pressure sensors) and magnetometer (compass).</B>
						</P>
						<p>
							Flight controller is also a hub for many other peripherals, such as GPS, LED, Sonar sensor etc.
						</p>


						<h4>Naze 32</h4>
						<p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/controller/1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
						</p>
						<p>The Naze32 is a small (36x36mm) flight controller based on 32-bit STM32 processor running at 72MHz. Comparing to other popular FC such as the KK2, APM2, and Crius AIO, which are all based on 8-bit platform running at 16Mhz.This board comes with two flavors, Acro Naze32 (FunFly) and Full Naze32.We are usin the ACRO version also called 6dof </p>
						<p> Although the Naze32 uses ported version of Multiwii, it’s not exactly a Multiwii flight controller, because it uses different type of processor (STM based). Normally, multiwii FC for example the Arduino, or Crius AIO FC are Atmel based. </p>
						<p>
							<div class="image fit"><img src="images/controller/2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
						</p>
						<p>
							This FC is getting more and more popular with mini size multicopter, due to it’s excellent performance and small size.
						</p>
						<P>
							If you have already used Naze32 before, you probably have installed the driver. But if you are new, or you are using a new computer that never has connected a Naze32 before, you will have to install the Driver first. Otherwise your board is not recognised and it won’t be assigned a COM port.
						</P>

						<h4>Typical Naze32 Connection diagram</h4>
						<div class="image fit"><img src="images/controller/3.jpg" alt="" /></div>
						<p>The diagram below shows a fairly common setup on a FPV racing quadcopter using a CPPM receiver, optional GPS module, and an RGB LED bar. </p>
