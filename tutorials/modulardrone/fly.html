						<p>How to fly a quadcopter the easy way</p>
					</header>
					<div class="image fit">
						<img src="images/fly/5.jpg" alt="" />
					</div>
					<p>Below are some graduated steps to help you learn how to fly a quadcopter.  To get the most benefit from this process, try to master each step before proceeding to the next.  Also, remember that learning how to fly a quadcopter isn’t something that happens overnight.  It will take you days to weeks to fully get comfortable with piloting a quadcopter.</p>
					<h2>Attention</h2>
					<div class="image fit">
						<img src="images/fly/12.jpg" alt="" />
					</div>

					<p>Make mistakes in the construction or flying or a drone is human but sometimes there is accidents.To avoid them we must follow some rules of safety before flying.
					When you build your machine don't put the propellers on until you are completely sure that everything is okey and correctly configured. Is recomendable to do a preflight check before your first flight.</p>

					<H2>First the "Movements"</H2>
					<div class="image fit">
						<img src="images/fly/4.jpg" alt="" />
					</div>

					<h2>Take off</h2>
					<p> Position your quadcopter on a flat surface.</p>
					<p>Make the throttle is at zero.   Turn the quadcopter on, and slowly begin increasing the throttle until your quadcopter is off the grown.</p>

					<P>
						<B>IF YOU PANIC BECAUSE IT IS OUT OF CONTROL PUSH THE THROTTLE DOWN! AND IT WILL SWITCH OFF!!!</B>
					</P>

					<P>
						Depending on your model, and how stable it is, you may need to use the other controls to keep it in place.  But at this point, you’ll mostly be using the throttle and you should focus on maintaining a consistent altitude.
					</P>
					<P>
					<blockquote>
						If this is very first flight, don’t be surprised if it’s short and very difficult.  The more you fly your quadcopter, the better you’ll get at flying it.
					</blockquote>
					</P>

										</div>
					<H2>Hover with your quadcopter</H2>

					<p>
						Again, at first you’ll want to focus on keeping your quadcopter at the same altitude, and in the same basic area.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Once you feel comfortable doing that, you can begin moving it forwards and backwards, using the elevator, and left and right using the Aileron.</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						 Pratice this for a bit, all while doing your best to maintain a consistent altitude.  You’ll probably note that when you move in any direction, the quadcopter will drop in altitude.  You’ll need to learn to give the quadcopter more power when turning or moving.
					</p>

					<h2>Fly your quadcopter in a circle</h2>
					<p>
						One you feel comfortable moving your quadcopter around and maintaining a similar altitude, you’ll next want to try make it go around in a circle. this is accomplished by using a combination of elevator and aileron.    Flying in a circle will take lots of practice, as you’ll need to manage the throttle as well.
					</p>

					<h2>Spin your Quadcopter</h2>
					<p>
						<b>WARNING - DON'T TRY THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE MASTER THE STEPS BEFORE!</b>
					</p>
					<P>
						The rudder will allow you to not only turn your quadcopter, but spin it as well.  When you spinning your quadcopter while making turns allows much smoother and faster movements.
					</P>
					<p>
						Again, these complex movements will be a bit tricky at first, but as they say “practice makes perfect”.  So just keep trying, and you’ll get the hang of it
					</p>
					<p>
						What gets a bit tricky is when the quadcopter is facing you.  The quadcopter controller now must be used in the opposite direction.  Just keep at it, and your brain and hands will learn to adjust
					</p>

					<H2>Fly your quadcopter in a figure eight</H2>
					<p>
						Once you have the circle movement with the rudder mastered, you’ll want to move on to a figure eight pattern.  Remembering all your previous moves will really aid you in making the copter make a figure eight.   The figure eight pattern will help you learn more controller dexterity and learn to switch the controller lever directions as needed, without thinking about it.
					</p>


					<H2>Respect always the AIR SPACE RULES of your country.These are the usual ones</H2>

					<h5>Enjoy your quadcopter and keep practicing!  The more you fly, the better you’ll get at controlling it</h5>
