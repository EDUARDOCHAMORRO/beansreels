      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">WHAT IS A MULTICOPTER AND WHAT IS A DRONE ?</p>
      <p class="paragraph">A multicopter is a mechanically simple aerial vehicle whose motion is  controlled by speeding or slowing multiple downward thrusting  motor/propeller units.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">An <strong>unmanned aerial vehicle </strong>(<strong>UAV</strong>), commonly known as a <strong>drone,</strong> as an <strong>unmanned aircraft system</strong> (<strong>UAS</strong>), and also referred by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle#Definition_and_terminology">several other names</a>, is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard. The flight of UAVs may be controlled with various kinds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_automation" title="Vehicular automation">autonomy</a> :   either by a given degree of remote control from an operator, located on   the ground or in another vehicle, or fully autonomously, by onboard   computers</p>
      <p class="paragraph">In the image we can see on the left a REAPER MILITARY UAV that is a	&quot;drone&quot; due to his autonomous capabilities.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">On the right is commercial DJI Phantom that is also a &quot;drone&quot; but also can be controlled in manual mode.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/22.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="390"></p>
      <p class="paragraph">The term "drone" is lazy and inexact. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">The fundamental difference between the terms &ldquo;<a href="http://dronewars.net/aboutdrone/" target="_blank">drone</a>&rdquo;   and &ldquo;quadcopter&rdquo; is one of characterization – drone is the general term   used for all unmanned aerial vehicles, though quadcopter identifies   with a particular set of drones with four engines that make lift for   vertical takeoff through their propellers</p>
      <p class="paragraph">1.  It isn't wrong to call almost any kind of remotely or self-directed vehicle a "drone."</p>
      <p class="paragraph">2.  All unmanned aircraft may be considered "drones."</p>
      <p class="paragraph">3.    It's basically impossible to come up with a currently flying example of   a quadcopter that isn't an unmanned aircraft (part of an "unmanned   aircraft system") and therefore, at the end of the day... a drone.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Quadcopter is drone, it&rsquo;s a fact. Pretty much like bacon is pork or maybe...a cow ?</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/11305601-large.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="471"></p>
      <p class="bluefullsize">What is the difference between a multicopter and a a drone ?</p>
      <p class="paragraph">A multicopter becomes a UAV or Drone when it is capable of autonomous  flight.  Normally this means taking the accelerometer and gyro  information and combining it with barometer and GPS data so the flight  controller understands not only it&rsquo;s orientation but also it&rsquo;s position.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">What does it means ? We can program it to go somewhere autonomously do something and return home.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/Agriculture-Drone-Buyers-Guide-flight-plan-for-quadcopter.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p class="paragraph">There is a video examplo of a &quot;drone&quot; multicopter wich can switch between &quot;manual mode &quot; and &quot;autonomous mode&quot;. <br>

      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Toy</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">The great majority of the drones you see   available all over the web. These are very simple crafts that don&rsquo;t have   a lot of expectations, other than having fun and learning what   controlling a multicopter feels like. The great majority of Toy drones   are in the quadcopter style. The range in Toy drones can be anything   from a simple quadcopter with a small camera to record to something to   something larger, but still the same form and function. Expect to pay   anywhere around $20 to $500. Common brands include Syma, Hubsan, Parrot,   Estes, Neewer, Cheerson, UDI, and others. For deeper <a href="http://www.propwashed.com/intro-toy-quadcopters/" target="_blank">recommendations of toy quadcopters</a>, check out our article on three of our favorites. </p>

      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Camera</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">The real division between this class of   drones and Toy drones will be in the technology they utilize. I call   these Camera drones, but they can also be called Hobby drones. Camera   drones are much more expensive, but come with much higher end   technology. They will often have higher end cameras (capable of   recording in 4K), advanced navigation components (such as GPS, vision   positing, etc), as well controllers with higher end features. Many also   relay video stream from the craft down to the pilot&rsquo;s smart phone or   tablet to give a kind of first person view. Camera drones will focus   more on the camera and its ability to capture high end footage. In order   to do so, they may also employ the assistance of a gimbal of some kind.   The gimbal provides stabilization via a number of different axes.   General cost is between $500 and $2,000. Common brands include DJI, 3DR,   Yuneec, Walkera, and others. </p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="modulardrone/drones-10-1024x768.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Cinema</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Cinema drones are similar to Camera drones,   but they take things to an entirely new level. While Camera drones will   capture great stabilized footage with either a proprietary camera or a   GoPro, Cinema drones offer higher weight carrying capacity to allow a   user to carry anything from a DSLR Camera to a high end film camera like   a RED Digital Cinema camera. At this point you will often see an   increased number of arms and motors as well as size. Cinema drones offer   no compromise when it comes to quality and features. Price range can go   from $2,000 to higher than $15,000. Companies might include Freefly,   DJI, xFold, and more custom made drones.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Industrial</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Industrial Drones are a very niche   category currently. Really what sets apart an Industrial drone apart is   more in what type of payload it is carrying. Instead of a camera that   records 4K video, it might carry a LIDAR system or thermal camera. These   drones fit specific roles in different industries. Maybe you&rsquo;re a   farmer who wants to look at the hydration of your crops, or a ski patrol   wanting to use <a href="http://www.dslrpros.com/thermal-solutions" target="_blank">thermal vision for search and rescue</a>,   the applications are wide. Not for your typical consumer, but this   category is quickly expanding. Can range anywhere from the low thousands   of dollars to several tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

      <p class="paragraph"><strong>FPV Racing</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Taking quadcopters and pushing them to   their flying limits! These quadcopters are typically smaller in size,   around 250mm in diagonal length, and are meant to push the limits of   both speed and maneuverability. For a great introductory look at the   components that make up and FPV Racer, be sure to read James&rsquo;s post. FPV   Racers are made FPV (first person view) by having an on-board camera   and a system in place to relay the camera footage to the pilot in   real-time allowing the pilot to have a &ldquo;cockpit&rdquo; type view. The   components come from a very wide range of manufacturers and many new   ones are being made all the time. A typical FPV setup will cost anywhere   from $300 to $800 or more.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">There are 3 algorithms in a PID controller, they are P, I, and D   respectively. P depends on the present error, I on the accumulation of   past errors, and D is a prediction of future errors, based on current   rate of change. These controller algorithms are translated into software   code lines.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="paragraph">TRANSMITTER MODES / HOW TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The remote control has some common main functions. For full autonomous operation at least six channels are required,with more you can assign more functions. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">- Throlle &gt; &gt; &gt; up/down in multicopters</p>
      <p class="paragraph">- Yaw / Rudder &gt; &gt; &gt; rotation on the Z axes</p>
      <p class="paragraph">- Roll / Ailerons &gt; &gt; &gt; rotation on the X axes</p>
      <p class="paragraph">- Pitch / Elevator &gt; &gt; &gt; rotation on the Y axes</p>
      <p class="paragraph">- Mode switch1/2/.. &gt; &gt; &gt; function assignation</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/tx_modes.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p class="paragraph">You'll see from the above 4 modes but few people fly anything other than   Mode 1 or 2. There are also modes 5-8 where the elevator is reversed so   the model goes up when you push the stick forward (yes, I have come   across somebody who flew this way, he had no help when he started out   and it made sense to him)</p>
      <p class="paragraph">There is no right or wrong way to learn, the percentages of people   flying on each mode varies in the UK and USA it is mainly mode 2, Europe   and Australia mode 1.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Most people the world over fly mode 1 or 2, so which should you chose?</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The technical answer is that for aircraft mode 1 is considered better as   it separates the two main controls (aileron and elevator), which helps   when flying precision aerobatics, also helps turning in racing multirotors as you mainly rotate with the rudder aka yaw, but there are many top competitive   aerobatic pilots flying mode 2. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Mode 2 is considered easier to learn as   you predominately use your right hand and most people are naturally   right handed.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/Parts-of-Transmitter-1024x834.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p class="paragraph"> All the transmissions between the remote and the receiver come in a &quot;coded&quot; frecuency the normal outputs for Radiocontrol frecuencies are CPPM / PPM sum signal, S-BUS or Spektrum Satellite. They are mainly propietary brand modulations, so if you get a Spektrum you can only use spektrum products or modulation compatible one. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Most people are using 2.4GHz technology, but we can still encounter some &ldquo;old&rdquo; 35MHz and 72MHz systems. </p>

      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">MOTORS BASIC CONCEPTS</p>
      <p class="paragraph">A multicopter is more efficient when it&rsquo;s lighter, so you need to pick a good battery that has good capacity but light weight.Although you can choose the motors for the weight you want to carry,   it&rsquo;s always a good idea to carry as little weight as possible. Lightness   is very important to all aircraft because any excess weight could   reduce your battery life and maneuverability</p>
      <p class="paragraph">A rule of thumb is<strong> Required Thrust per motor = ( Weight x 2 ) / 4</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/00977d2fd93568c9a641c7720e9cb5cd2f61b7f4.png" alt=""></p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Brushed vs Brushless</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/brushed-brushless.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Advantage of brushed motors</p>
      <p class="paragraph">-Inexpensive </p>
      <p class="paragraph">-Simple wiring</p>
      <p class="paragraph">-No need specialized ESC</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Advantages of brushless</p>
      <p class="paragraph">-Very low maintenance</p>
      <p class="paragraph">-Higher speeds achievable</p>
      <p class="paragraph">-Higher efficiency</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/maxresdefault.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Motors used these days are almost exclusively of the &ldquo;brushless&rdquo; variety. That equates to minimal friction.A cylindrical shell of magnets rotates on precision bearings around a core of tightly and neatly coiled wire. </p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/brushless_motor_1-300x212.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Battery and weight is not the only factor we need to consider when it   comes to Efficiency, there is also motor efficiency. When choosing   motors, apart from motor KV and thrust, we also need to look at Watt&rsquo;s   and efficiency.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">MATCHING AN ESC TO YOU MOTOR (Electronic Speed Controller)</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Now that we have confirmed that this motor is suitable for our   application, we look at the Amp draw for our chosen   motor/battery/propeller. In our case, this is maximum of 7.5A for a 5x3   prop, and 11.5A for a 6x3 prop.  Since in our build we chose the 9x4   propellers, so we will need to use an ESC that is rated over 20A, so an30A ESC would be a good choice for this motor/propeller running on a 3S   battery.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">PROPELLERS AND ROTATION</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/images1.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p class="paragraph">A quadcopter uses two clockwise(CW) and two counter-clockwise(CCW)   propellers. Propellers are classified by length and pitch. For example   9×4.7 propellers are 9 inch long and has a pitch of 4.7.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Generally, increased propeller pitch and length will draw more current.   Also the pitch can be defined as the travel distance of one single prop   rotation. In a nutshell, higher pitch means slower rotation, but will   increase your vehicle speed which also use more power</p>
      <p class="paragraph">.<img src="beandrone/propeller-pitch-300x92.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p class="paragraph">There are a few different types of propellers, such as plastic, carbon fibre etc.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">A higher pitch propeller moves greater amount of air, which could create   turbulence and cause the aircraft to wobble during hovering. If you   notice this with your quadcopter, try to choosing a lower pitched   propeller.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">When it comes to the length, propeller efficiency is closely related to   the contact area of a prop with air, so a small increase in prop length   will increase the propeller efficiency. (pretty much like swimmers with   larger hands and feet can swim faster, but also more tiring for them)</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The orientation of the propeller depends mainly on your frame configuration.Each propeller needs an &quot;opposite&quot; so the torque that it produces is eliminated by another one.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">A classic craft many people are familiar   with. Check out explainthatstuff.com for a more in-depth look at the   technology of a helicopter. In the RC world, helicopters can range   greatly from the toy level to the high-end pro-hobbyist level. The   high-end helicopters can have incredibly finite control of movement and   are powered by fuel.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Monocopte</strong><strong>r</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph"> A craft that is propelled and controlled   with a single rotor. Very experimental and not practical for a hobbyist   or consumer. Most monocopters are test type designs and aren&rsquo;t very   common among drones.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Bicopter</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Bicopters are similar to Monocopters in that   they are much more uncommon and experimental in nature. The most famous   bicopter is probably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Boeing_V-22_Osprey" target="_blank">Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey</a>.   The Osprey is controlled via two rotors that rotate to allow for both   vertical take-off and forward movement. While it did try to combine the   convenience of vertical take-off without jet motors, like the Harrier   Jump Jet, and long distance flight, it is very technically complicated.   Interestingly a <a href="http://xcraft.io/x-plusone-drone/" target="_blank">drone company xCraft</a>,   did develop a drone which behaves like a typical quadcopter when taking   vertical flight, it does move into a sideways position for longer   distance flying. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Tricopter</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph"> A craft that&rsquo;s powered by three motors.   Still very much an uncommon type of craft. When compared to a quadcopter   (which uses four motors), you do lose lifting power, but gain simpler   construction and a change in maneuverability. Many people also prefer   this configuration as it is much less common while still being viable.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Y6</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Y6 is a common term to describe the formation of   a tricopter that uses six motors. The motors are paired together on the   arms, where one is above the frame and one is below. This allows for   more power (more thrust) without having to add more arms or increasing   the size of the craft. Still a very uncommon craft.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Quadcopter</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">The bread and butter. The reason drones   have become so incredibly popular today. A quadcopter is a formation in   which it has four arms, each of which has its own motor. They are much   simpler to fly when compared to other flight crafts. They can be much   smaller and carry more weight. Thanks to the onboard computers being so   smart and capable of doing a portion of the flying for the pilot, it   becomes incredibly accessible for people to capture incredible footage   without being experts at flying the craft itself. When people were able   to take a craft up into the air, easily capture a viewpoint we&rsquo;ve never   seen before so simply, it exploded the world of drones.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>VTail</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">A quadcopter that still has four motors to   create thrust, but in a VTail formation, two of the four motors are   placed closer together and also placed at an angle. Looks pretty   fantastic, but seems to only have downsides when speaking in terms of   flight performance. Less overall thrust and worse maneuvering, but it   looks cool!</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="paragraph"><strong>X8</strong></span>
      <p class="paragraph">Similar to a quadcopter, but instead of only four   motors, it has eight motors. Still in the same shape and form as a   quadcopter, but has a motor both above and below the arms.Increases the carrying capacity
      <p>
      <p  class="paragraph"><strong>Hexacopter</strong></span>
      <p class="paragraph">A craft which has six arms and six   motors. The additional arms provide greater lift .   Hexacopters are great   when you care more about your payload (such as an expensive camera) and    in the case of a failure.
      <p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Octocopter</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Six motors was pretty good, why not   eight! The additional two arms are even more redundancy and stability.   The main downside to this is the increased cost. An octocopter setup is   most ideal of Cinema style drones.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<a class="bluefullsize" id="batteries"><strong> Part eight - batteries &quot; Hello Lipo &quot;</strong></a></p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/LiPo_Numbers.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p class="paragraph">LiPo batteries (short for Lithium Polymer) are a type   of rechargeable battery that has taken the electric RC world by storm,   especially for planes, helicopters, and <a href="http://www.rchelicopterfun.com/quadrocopter.html">multi-rotor</a>. They are the main reason electric   flight is now a very viable option over fuel powered models. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">&gt; &gt; &gt; LiPo batteries are light weight and can be made in almost any shape and size</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&gt; &gt; &gt; Rc LiPo have large capacities, meaning they hold lots of energy in a small package</p>
      <p class="paragraph"> &gt; &gt; &gt; Rc LiPo have high discharge rates to power the most demanding electric motors</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>VOLTAGE</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Unlike conventional NiCad or NiMH battery   cells that have a nominal voltage of 1.2 volts per cell, LiPo battery   cells have a nominal voltage of 3.7 volts   per cell. </p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>3.7 volt battery = 1 cell x 3.7 volts  (1S)</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>7.4 volt battery = 2 cells x 3.7 volts  (2S) </strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>11.1 volt battery = 3 cells x 3.7 volts (3S)</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>14.8 volt battery = 4 cells x 3.7 volts (4S)</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>18.5 volt battery =  5 cells x 3.7 volts (5S)</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>22.2 volt battery = 6 cells x 3.7 volts (6S) </strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>29.6 volt battery = 8 cells x 3.7 volts (8S)</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>37.0 volt battery = 10 cells x 3.7 volts (10S</strong>)</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>44.4 volt battery = 12 cells x 3.7 volts (12)</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Unlike conventional NiCad or NiMH battery   cells that have a nominal voltage of 1.2 volts per cell, LiPo battery   cells have a nominal voltage of 3.7 volts   per ceLL</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>CAPACITY</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Capacity indicates how much power the battery pack can hold and   is indicated in miliamp hours (mAh). This is just a fancy way of saying   how much load or drain (measured in milliamps) can be put on the   battery for 1 hour at which time the battery will be fully discharged.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"> <img src="beandrone/lipo_Batt_foilpouch_300pics.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p class="paragraph">The main thing to get out of this is <strong>if you want more flight   time; increase the capacity of your battery pack</strong>. Unlike voltage,   capacity can be changed around to give you more or less flight time. </p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>DISCHARGE RATE</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Discharge rate is simply how fast a battery can be discharged   safely. Remember that ion exchange thing further up the page? Well the   faster the ions can flow from anode to cathode in a battery will   indicate the discharge rate. In the RC LiPo battery world it is called   the <strong>&ldquo;C&rdquo; rating</strong>. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="beandrone/2872-lipo-exploded-view_m.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Most RC LiPo Battery packs will show the continuous C rating and   usually a maximum burst C rating as well. A burst rating indicates the   battery discharge rate for short bursts (<strong>a few seconds maximum</strong>) of extended power. An   example might be something like "Discharge rate = 25C Continuous/50C   Bursts". </p>

      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Naze 32 rev6</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The Naze32 is a small (36x36mm) flight controller based on 32-bit STM32   processor running at 72MHz. Comparing to other popular FC such as the   KK2, APM2, and Crius AIO, which are all based on 8-bit platform running   at 16Mhz.This board comes with two flavors, Acro Naze32 (FunFly) and Full Naze32.We are usin the ACRO version also called 6dof</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Although the Naze32 uses ported version of Multiwii, it&rsquo;s not exactly a   Multiwii flight controller, because it uses different type of processor   (STM based). Normally, multiwii FC for example the Arduino, or Crius AIO   FC are Atmel based.      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="dronetheory/2.jpg"></p>
      <p class="paragraph">This FC is getting more and more popular with mini size multicopter, due to it&rsquo;s excellent performance and small size.<img src="dronetheory/977a2a3924cfb004ccd942228e96e4657a292b5b_1_689x385.jpg"></p>
      <p class="paragraph">If you have already used   Naze32 before, you probably have installed the driver. But if you are   new, or you are using a new computer that never has connected a Naze32   before, you will have to install the Driver first. Otherwise your board   is not recognised and it won&rsquo;t be assigned a COM port.      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">We are goint to use CLEAN FLIGHT SOFTWARE FOR CONFIGURING THE PARAMETERS OF THE BOARD<a href="http://cleanflight.com"/target="_blank"><b> here is the download link</b></a></p>
      <p class="paragraph">There&rsquo;s a link for the driver right in the Cleanflight GUI , but in case you can&rsquo;t find it, here is the <a href="http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/pages/usbtouartbridgevcpdrivers.aspx" target="_blank"><b>driver download address</b></a>.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Once the driver is installed successfully, you should see this in your   device manager, with a COM port number assigned. If not, try to restart   your computer first.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>FLASH FIRMWARE ON THE BOARD</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">When you open the CleanFlight GUI, you will notice it won&rsquo;t connect no matter how hard you press the &ldquo;connect&rdquo; button.      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Firmware flashing is really simple and straight forward. Open the   Configurator GUI, choose the COM port for your board. Then go to   &ldquo;Firmware Flasher&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><img src="dronetheory/b9343d23d6192fe1b4a5233cc7e3dbf1eaeda9d0_1_530x500.jpg"></p>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">LEDs on your Naze32 or CC3D will start blinking, when it finishes   flashing firmware, the LED will stay on solid again. This will take less   than a minute.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Some people might accidentally flash the wrong firmware (e.g. flashed   CC3D version on the Naze32), and you can&rsquo;t talk to the board anymore.   Simple fix is to short the bootloader pads on the board, and check &ldquo;No   Reboot Option&rdquo; and &ldquo;Flash on connect&rdquo; (only appear when the first option   is checked). Then load the correct firmware and flash again</p>
