Main mistakes to avoid:

- never talk in first person.
- no personal opinions even if objective
- *on the final part on research papers you don´t give opinion you write conclusions given by the results of the study, not really opinions*
- get to extended and talk about 2,3 different subjects instead of focusing in 1 and get real conclusions.


## Research Definition

 The systematic investigation into and study of materials and sources in order to stablish facts and reach new conclusions

## Sources

*Google is not your friend .Google* **Scholar** *is*
 - Find credible sources
 - Again Google is not your friend
 - Find prominent authors
 - **Find recent publications**
 - Search outside your domain
 - Research your sources

#### **Sources as reference**

  *As search engines*
- [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.es/)
- [Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/)

*To get the papers*
- [Sci-hub](https://sci-hub.hk/) *if the link doesn´t work look in wikipedia Sci-Hub to check the actual link*
- PUblishers (Elsevier,Istor,Springer)
- Conferences (ACADIA, ASCAAD, CAADRIA, CAADFutures, eCAADe, Sigradi)
- [CumInCad] (http://papers.cumincad.org/) *Mainly related to architecture papers*


>To know if the publication are important you could check for* **IMPACT FACTOR** inside the search engines

#### **Citations Creator Websites** *AKA Resource managers*

Recommended [Chicago Citation](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) and Hardvard style.
