- Color of a can material change if you change the size at a nano scale.
> GoLD can change for example from pink to blue,etc

#### Graphene

Graphene is a nanostructure of graphite aligned in a 2 dimensional hexagonal grid. Is of the family of **Carbon polymorphs** The diference with diamonds is that diamonds are a 3 dimensional estructure amongs others.

**Fullerenes** is another polymorph as carbon nanotubes as it bigger representative.
**Graphite** could be considered a book of graphene layers stacked one to each other.

- 2630 m2 per gram
- waterproof
- flexible
- thermal conductivity 5 times stronger than copper
- very good electrical conductor
- 100 times more stronger than steel
>Konstant Novoselov, and Andre Gein disconver the ways of producing graphene in an economic way.Making them win the Nobel Price in Physics in 2010 That was by using scotch tape over graphite.

#### How tu use Graphene

Graphene is very small to handle and manipulate you have to process it as:
- ink *solved in organic solvents, graphene oxide dissolved in water, graphene dissolved in water*
- composite *polymer+graphene*
- precursor *growing graphene on substrates*

> graphene nanopatellets is one of the preferred nano structures to work with.

Graphene ink contains aprox. 1-10% of Graphene, nice utilities for:
- impregnation
- spray coating
- solvent casting
- inkjet printing

Composites can be created by dissolving polymers in the ink dispersing the graphene in melt polymer co-extrusion

#### Achieving electrical/thermal conductivity

When concentration of graphene is high enough there is a continous path for tranmitivity.
The highlighted concentration is called **Percolation Threshold**, usually 5-10% by volume is needed.

#### Standart mixture

- PVP - polyvinyl pyrrolidone ( water dispersant for graphene)
- graphene nanoplatelets
> 100ml water + 2 grams of PVP mix well and after add 2 grams of graphene *formula for water based inks*
